## 1. Introduction
The **Movies App** provides an easy way to search for movies and add them to your favorites list.

## 2. Setting up the environment
### 2.1 Providing a database service
Since this application requires a MongoDB instance, you should provide one according to your operational system.

    mkvirtualenv -p python3 movies
### 2.3 Installing both Python and Node dependencies
    make dependencies
